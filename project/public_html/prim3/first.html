 	<p>Hi! my name is <i>Ryutaro Matsuda</i>. I am one of <b>international student</b> who comes from <u>Japan</u>. I have been      attending at SCC for 3 semesters (include summer). My major is a computer science and engineering. therefore, I have taken some CISP classes. Right now, I am enrolling a CISP 400 which is C++ class. This is the first time to learn other than C++/C so I am kind of excited. Well... When I finished this class, hopefuly I could get part time job for web design. Well other than computer, I like skateboarding. I have been skating for almost one year though still I am beginer level. Anyway, Nice to see you.
